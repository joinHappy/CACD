You can use my work & data for any motivation.

If you find my code or my dataset is helpful. Please refer to my paper:
Yao, Zhenjie, and Weidong Yi. "Curvature aided Hough transform for circle detection." Expert Systems with Applications 51 (2016): 26-33.

I get a lot of help from Tao Peng's work, which can be found here:
